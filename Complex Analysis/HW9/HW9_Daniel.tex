%Uniform Continuity
\Problem
Define:
\[
    f_n(x) := 
    \frac{n}{1+nx^2}
\]

Prove that $f_n$ is uniformly continuous. 

Is the family of function
$\mathcal{F}:=\{f_n(x)|n\in \ZZ_{pos}\}$ equicontinuous?

\new{Proposition} $\frac{x}{1+nx^2}$ is bounded. 

\Proof
First, consider the function in the range 
$x \in \RR \setminus [-1, 1]$. Within the range, 
we have $|x| > 1$ and hence $x^2 > 1$. Write:

\[
    |\frac{x}{1+nx^2}| < |\frac{x}{nx^2}| = |\frac{1}{nx}| < 1
\]
Now, consider the range $x \in [-1, 1]$. Write:

\[
    |\frac{x}{1+nx^2}| < |\frac{x}{1}| < 1
\]

This shows that our function is bounded for $x\in \RR$
\qed

\new{Claim} $f_n(x)$ is uniformly continuous. 
Given any $\epsilon > 0$, we wish to obtain a $\delta_{max}$ where
for any $\delta$ such that $|\delta| < \delta_{max}$ satisfies:

\[
    |f_n(x)-f_n(x+\delta)| < \epsilon
\]
Or equivalently
\[
  |\frac{n}{1+nx^2} -\frac{n}{1+n(x+\delta)^2}| <\epsilon 
\]
Notice:
\[
  |\frac{n}{1+nx^2} -\frac{n}{1+n(x+\delta)^2}| <
|\frac{n}{1+nx^2} -\frac{n}{1+n(x+\delta_{max})^2}| 
\]
It suffices to construct $\delta_{max}$ that satisfies:

\[
    |\frac{n}{1+nx^2} -\frac{n}{1+n(x+\delta_{max})^2}| 
    < \epsilon
\]

Through some algebra:
\[
    |\frac{
    n 
    \left[
    1+n(x+\delta_{max})^2 - (1+nx^2) 
    \right]
    }
    {(1+nx^2)(1+n(x+\delta_{max})^2)}|
     < \epsilon
\]
\[
    |\frac{
    n 
    \left[
    2nx\delta_{max} + n\delta_{max}^2
    \right]
    }
    {(1+nx^2)(1+n(x+\delta_{max})^2)}|
     < \epsilon
\]
\[
    |\frac{
    n^2\delta_{max}
    \left[
    2x + \delta_{max}
    \right]
    }
    {(1+nx^2)(1+n(x+\delta_{max})^2)}|
     < \epsilon
\]

Set $\delta_{max} < 1$. Also, notice that the 
terms in the denominators are both greater than 1. 
We construct a $\delta_{max}$ that satisfies a stronger 
condition:

\[
    |\frac{
        n^2\delta_{max}(2x+1)
    }
    {1+nx^2}|
    <\epsilon
    \textOr
    |\delta_{max}||n^2||
    \frac{2x}{1+nx^2}+
    \frac{1}{1+nx^2}|
    < \epsilon
\]

It is easy to see that the function $\frac{1}{1+nx^2}$
is bounded. The denominator is always greater than 1, 
so the function is bounded by 1. We have shown that the second
summand is bounded for any real $x$. Again, we construct 
a stronger $\delta_{max}$ that satisfies:

\[
    |\delta_{max}|B<\epsilon
\]

Where $B$ is the maximum bound of the other terms. 
If $B < 0$, the statement is a tauology. Otherwise, 
set $\delta = \epsilon /(2B)$. This concludes the proof. 
\qed 

\new{Claim} The family $\mathcal{F}$ is not equicontinuous

\Proof  We claim that equicontinuity is 
violated at $x = 0$. Notice that $f_n(0) = n$.
Assume for a contradiction, that $\mathcal{F}$
is equicontinuous at $x = 0$. For $\epsilon = 1$, 
it must be possible to obtain a $\delta_{max}$ 
where for all $\delta$ such that
$|\delta| < \delta_{max}$, $\delta$ satisfies:
\[
    |f_n(0) - f_n(\delta)| < 1 
    \textOr
    |n - f_n(\delta)| < 1
\]
So 
\[
    |f_n(\delta)| > n-1
\]
$\delta \neq 0$ by assumption, so as $n \rightarrow \infty$, 
$|f_n(\delta)| \rightarrow 1$. This is a contradiction.

%PW convergence of spike
\Problem
Define:
\[
    f_n(x) := 
    \begin{cases}
        1-nx & (x \in (0, 1/n)) \\ 
        0 & (\textrm{Otherwise})
    \end{cases}
\]
Show that the limit of this function exists and 
find the limit. 

\new{Solution}
Consider the function: 
\[
    f(x) := 
    \begin{cases}
        1 & (x = 0) \\ 
        0 & (x \neq 0)
    \end{cases}
\]
We claim that $f_n$ converges to $f$ pointwise. We must show
that for any $x_0 \in \RR$, the following equality holds:

\[
    \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}
    f_n(x_0) = f(x_0)
\]

If $x_0 \leq 0$, the problem becomes trivial. If the inequality
is strict, $f_n(x_0) = 0$
regardless of the value of $n$. Also computing the value 
of $f_n(0)$, we notice that the value is identically $1$, 
regardless of the value of $n$. 

It remains to demonstrate the equality for $x_0 > 0$. 
Recall that $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} 1/n = 0$. Hence, it 
is possible to obtain a sufficiently large integer $N$ such that 
for any $n > N$, we have $1/n < x_0$. By the construction of 
$f_n(x)$, $f_n(x_0) = 0$ for any $n > N$. This concludes the proof. 
\qed

%PW convergence of spike
\Problem
Define:
\[
    f_n(x) := 
    \begin{cases}
        1-nx & (x \in (0, 1/n)) \\ 
        0 & (\textrm{Otherwise})
    \end{cases}
\]

and,
\[
    \mathcal{F}:= \{f_n(x)|n \in \ZZ_{pos}\}
\]

Is the family $\mathcal{F}$ normal?

\new{Claim}
No, $\mathcal{F}$ is not normal. 

\Proof
Assume for a contradiction, that indeed the family is normal. 
Then, the entire family $\mathcal{F}$ must have some subsequence
of functions that converge uniformly. Let the sequence of functions 
$\{f_{m_1}, f_{m_2}, f_{m_3}, \dots \}$ be such a sequence of functions.

For the value $\epsilon = 1/4$, we extract some integer $N$ such that 
for any $n > N$, the function achieves:

\[
    |f_{m_n}(x)-f(x)| < 1/4
\]

For any real value $x$. $f(x)$ is some imaginary function 
that the subsequence uniformly converges to. Extract another 
arbitrary integer $k > N$ that satisfies the same condition. 
Adding the two inequalities, we obtain:

\[
    |f_{m_n}(x)-f(x)| + |f_{m_k}(x)-f(x)| < 1/2
\]

Which implies, by the triangle inequality:

\[
    |f_{m_n}(x) - f_{m_k}(x)| < 1/2
\]

And this is for any values of $n, k > N$. 
We explicitly construct a value $x_0$ that violates 
this inequality. 

Take any integer $n$ greater than $N$. Obtain 
$k$ such that $m_k > 2m_n$. This is possible because 
$m$ is a strictly increasing sequence of integers. 
Set $x_0 = 1/m_k$. Write:

\[
|f_{m_n}(x_0) - f_{m_k}(x_0)| = |f_{m_n}(1/m_k)-f_{m_k}(1/m_k)|
\]
Notice that the latter summand vanishes. Also the fraction 
$1/m_k$ is between zero and $1/m_n$. We proceed to write:
\[
    |f_{m_n}(x_0) - f_{m_k}(x_0)| = |1-m_n/m_k| > 1/2
\]

by construction. But then again, this whole absolute value 
must be less than $1/2$, which is a contradiction. \qed
