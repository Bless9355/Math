\section{Introduction}
As shown in previous studies \cite{Caceres2010, Namba1989}, the dynamics of population matrices can be complex.

\section{Methodology}
The control of chaos in mechanical systems has also been explored \cite{Garcia2007}.

\section{Results}
Adaptive dynamics in ecological models have been studied in depth \cite{Metz2004}.
